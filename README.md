After seeing videos of numerous teenagers being injured or losing their lives due to the distractions of their mobile devices, we decided to develop an android application that allows users to text while viewing their surroundings through their camera preview. This allows the user to be more aware of their surroundings while texting on their cellular devices. While anyone with an android device that texts can use the app, the target users are teenagers as they tend to utilize texting more than any other age group. We are proud to introduce a smart messaging app with sending and receiving functionality along with a live video feed in the same activity. In addition, we have imported the user's contact list for ease of use. We have a major improvements for this app in the future including object congregation for detecting street objects (such as cars and poles) and warning the user. We also plan to significantly improve the UI by allocating more space for the camera video feed. For the keyboard, we plan to add a sliding functionality that allows you to move the cursor with ease.
